  "Functions to create and manipulate a cache for storing the results
of aggregations. This cache will be used to serve up aggregations to
API users without having to go through Mongo's aggregation framework.

The cache uses `clojure.core.cache`'s `CacheProtocol` so that it has a
standard interface. Unlike the caches that come with
`clojure.core.cache`, however, our `QueryCache` is stateful, as it's
backed by MongoDB. That means two instances of the cache created with
the same backing database have access to the same data."
