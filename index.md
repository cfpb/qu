Qu is a framework for building data APIs. It is still under heavy development and is changing rapidly.

Qu was created to serve the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau's public data sets.

## A Data Platform

Qu serves up data stored in MongoDB. Qu provides an API that allows for rich queries of the data.
    
## Standards-Based

Qu queries are very similar to the <a href="http://dev.socrata.com/consumers/getting-started">SODA 2.0 API</a>.
    
Data is imported into Qu using a JSON variant of <a href="https://developers.google.com/public-data/">        Google's Dataset Publishing Language</a>.
    
Qu is REST-ful. Using hypermedia and response headers, it should present a fully-discoverable API to clients.

## Open Source

Qu is an open-source project. Your contributions are invited! [See the code at GitHub.](https://github.com/cfpb/qu/)
